Angular Meteor Boilerplate
==========================

This is a bare application for quickly setting up an angular meteor app.

Commands that that you would normally run to create this:
	* meteor create x
	* meteor remove ecmascript
	* meteor remove blaze-html-templates
	* meteor add angular

Instead of doing this everytime, just clone this repo.
