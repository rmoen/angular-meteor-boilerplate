Angular Meteor Boilerplate
======================

This is a bare application for quickly setting up an angular meteor app.

Commands that that you would normally run to create this:
    

> meteor create x
 meteor remove ecmascript
 meteor remove blaze-html-templates
 meteor add angular

Instead of doing this everytime, just clone this repo.
>git clone https://github.com/rmoen/angular-meteor-boilerplate.git

Sometimes you may need to run:
>meteor update
